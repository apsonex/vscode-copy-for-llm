# Copy Code For LLM

Copy-for-LLM is a VS Code extension that helps you quickly prepare code and files for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
It can copy selected files/folders or code to the clipboard in a format ready for LLM input, and also open selected code directly in ChatGPT.
